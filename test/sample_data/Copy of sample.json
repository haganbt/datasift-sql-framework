The four bullies Trevor, James, Leo and Jack were standing there laughing and Trevor the leader of the gang said \u201CNO! Why would we do that?\u201D Rory Whispered \u201Cplease, please just go\u201D. Trevor put Rory against the wall and shouted \u201Cwere you speaking about me?\u201D Rory stayed silent Trevor waited for about 10 seconds and shouted \u201Chuh ignoring me yeah? Bad idea you better watch your back.\u201D Rory was petrified but he thought he had to get on with his day so he didn\u2019t tell anyone\n. Through the day Rory was getting more scared as the day went on but he hid it with a fake smile. Carly Rory\u2019s friend thought something was wrong but didn\u2019t quite know and she was quite worried about her best friend. Before the next lesson Carly pulled Rory to one side and asked \u201CWhat\u2019s up bud\u201D Rory replied \u201Cnothing look I\u2019m smiling\u201D and put on a fake smile once again to hide the pain. Carly didn\u2019t believe that smile she was the only person that could tell Rory\u2019s proper feelings. Carly then said in a caring voice \u201CRight I know there\u2019s something wrong and I\u2019m going to find out sooner or later. So when are you going to tell me?\u201D Rory started to cry and Carly decided to give Rory a massive hug. Rory explained \u201CI\u2019m getting bullied and it started two days ago.\u201D Carly was shocked that someone would do that to Rory. Carly didn\u2019t know how to reply to that but she found a reply \u201CCome on Rory, lift your head up for me\u201D. Rory head slowly rose as he walked to tutor. \nIn Rory\u2019s tutor were Trevor, James, Leo, Jack, Rachay, Jenny, Leah, Carly, Peter, Liam and Julie. In Rory\u2019s head no one in his tutor cares and the boys didn\u2019t but the girls cared about him more than he would ever know. Mrs Lowe, Rory\u2019s tutor she was a very nice teacher probably the nicest at the school. She was the teacher you could trust. She made an announcement that it was her last term at West Lake Secondary School. Everyone was sad except the bullies, they were cheering at the back of the classroom.\n The bell went and everyone left for the next class. Rory was the last one to leave the classroom Carly wanted to see if anything happened as the gang was out just before him so Carly hid. The gang of the 4 boys came behind Rory and followed him for a little while and then attacked him Leo held him still while Trevor, James and jack was punching and kicking Rory. Carly ran over to the pain struck boy rolling on the floor. Carly ran and got some her name was Rachay she was in Rory and Carly\u2019s tutor Rachay ran as fast as she could and got a teacher. The teacher didn\u2019t see what happened so she couldn\u2019t punish anyone and Rachay and Carly was really frustrated. \nIn maths Rory was finishing his work but paper kept on being thrown at him with threatening notes. Rory started to cry, everyone was wondering what was happening except from Bullies as they knew Carly and Rachay ran over to see what was wrong. Rory didn\u2019t answer he was too busy drowning in his tears\n. It was lunch and Rachay and Carly was sitting with Rory, Rory was still upset from the threats. Rory didn\u2019t eat much and Rachay and Carly was getting worried. Rory was starving himself. Rachay was thinking that but didn\u2019t think it was his sort of thing. Rachay, Carly and Rory was speaking about One Direction\u2019s new album \u201CTake Me Home\u201D and what their favourite song on it. Leo told Trevor what they were talking about it. Trevor approached the table they were sitting at Rory was about to walk away but Trevor grabbed his arm and twisted it Rory began to cry Rachay started to shout At Trevor \u201CWhat do you think you\u2019re doing? Get of him now!\u201D Trevor laughed and then let go and punched Rory, Rory began to cry. Carly ran and got a teacher she didn\u2019t believe that Trevor did it and when she went Trevor began to laugh as he walked away.\n In tutor and the end of the day Mrs Lowe revealed there will be a new pupil being added to the tutor group. Rory was getting a bit nervous of what their think of him. Loads of different questions went round in his head. Will he be another bully? Or will he be a victim? Will he be a friend? Or Enemy?\nIt was the end of school everyone went home Rory had to walk home today because his dad was at work and his mum was picking his brother up. Rory was quite scared because he didn\u2019t know if the bullies would be their which they were Rory ran to his house scared as they were following him he called Rachay and she came over to protect him. She felt it was her job to do so Rory didn\u2019t think anyone cared about him but Rachay and Carly definitely did they were there for him always.\n Rory was twelve and his bully s are 12-16 and he hated his life and people hated him so much. On Saturdays he attends a club where people bully him there too so he has about 8 bullies. \nIt was Friday and Rory went through his normal routine getting changed, brushing his teeth and eating breakfast etc. Rory was at breakfast when he got a text from a number he hasn\u2019t received a call or text from before. He thought it was the gang of four who bullies him and he was correct. It read \u201CGET READY TO DIE, YOU F****** B***.\u201D Rory was petrified he was right to be too. At school before everyone went to tutor everyone was in the halls and Rory saw the bullies and hoped they didn\u2019t see him. The speakers boomed out \u201Ctoday our new student starts his name is Matthew please help him settle in\u201D it went silent for about 10 seconds but the chatter started again Matthew had to wear name badge to be recognised. Rory was thinking he must be so embarrassed and he was correct. Matthew had been approached by the gang already and he was welcomed and the bullies was being nice for change, probably hoping for a new member. Julie in Rory\u2019s tutor went to speak to Matthew and he wasn\u2019t shy at all. Julie asked \u201CDo you like bullies?\u201D he replied \u201Cof course not why\u201D Julie pointed at the four and said \u201Cyou know them you just spoke to? There the bullies of this school\u201D.   He replied that he want to support the victim of the bullying. Julie led him to Rory. She explained \u201Cthis is the victim, he might not answer. He\u2019s really shy.\u201D Rory had his head down at the floor and staring at his feet. Matthew said \u201CHi I\u2019m the new boy I heard you\u2019re being bullied.\u201D Rory Replied \u201CYeah why\u201D Matthew said \u201CI want to help you\u201D. Rory just laughed. \nOn the way to class Matthew did the same as Carly and hid as he wanted to know the bullies were like. The bullies started to insult and threaten him like normal. Matthew came over to the bullies and went face to face and explained \u201CI\u2019ve heard enough of you already and I only just started. STOP BULLYING HIM OR ILL SORT IT OUT!\"  Trevor replied \u201CHaha bring it on your new and you sticking up for this t***.\u201D Rory started to cry. Matthew took Rory to one side and said \u201Care they like this all the time?\u201D Rory just nodded. Matthew took him to class.\nOn Friday after school he started to believe what people was saying didn\u2019t eat at all and started to begin self-harming himself. He would cut his wrists and hands. He didn\u2019t care he just did it yeah it was painful but it was less pain than getting bullied every day and non-stop.   He wanted to end it but he thought of his friends and what they would do and he didn\u2019t want to ruin their lives. He even wondered if they really cared, if they actually were his friends and if Matthew was using him. Rory was getting abuse. Rachay told him to like the page NO Bullying which he did he became friends with the owner Jennifer and Rory made a friend on their called Amanda she was from Ireland and they became pen-pals. She became good friends with Rory and built his confidence like Carly, Rachay, Matthew and Jenny is trying to do. Rory has been holding real emotions all his life as he thought no one cares or wants to listen about his life so he would just smile and when people ask if he\u2019s ok he would say I\u2019m fine. His friends had enough of him lying about his emotions and met up and discussed about it. They wished he would tell the truth so they could sort it out but Rory was worried if telling them would get him more bullied so he decided to suffer in silence. He received a text from Matthew saying he wants to meet up Rory Replied \u201Cok Cool\u201D. Rory walked to the park and Matthew was there with two people Rory hasn\u2019t seen before and he got scared. Matthew said \u201Ccalm down these are my friends they have been bullied but not as bad as you and I think you will get on well\u201D. Rory just smiled he said nervously \u201CWhat\u2019s their names?\u201D Matthew replied \u201CLulu and Lola\u201D.  Rory whispered \u201CHi\u201D Lulu replied first \u201CHi what\u2019s up?\u201D Rory replied \u201CBullies\u201D Lulu said \u201Caw I did but they made me who I am.\u201D Everyone went silent.  Lola thought she should lighten the mood so she said enthusiastically \u201CHey, I\u2019m Lola. I know how you feel I have been through it before but I\u2019m here to help you\u201D. Rory smiled.\n\nThe next day in maths everyone was speaking except from Rory he just sat there hiding his arms. Matthew saw this and told Rachay and Carly to see if it happens all the time. Rachay whispered \u201CDo you think he\u2019s self-harming himself?\u201D Carly said \u201CI hope not do you want me to ask?\u201D Rachay nodded. Carly approached Rory and asked \u201CWhat\u2019s up? Why are you covering your arms?\u201D Rory replied \u201CNothing and I\u2019m just cold.\u201D Matthew came over as Carly walked away. Matthew explained \u201CYou can tell us mate, were trying to look after you.\u201D Rory whispered to Matthew \u201CI have had enough of my life.\u201D Matthew replied \u201CLet me see your arms.\u201D Rory pulled his sleeves up meanwhile he was crying. Matthew explained \u201CYou shouldn\u2019t do this even if you\u2019re getting bullied.\u201D Through the tears Rory explained \u201CI\u2019ve can\u2019t cope anymore even though I couldn\u2019t cope from the beginning.\u201D Matthew nodded to Rachay, Julie, Lulu and Carly to show what they feared has happened. A girl at front called Frankie Rory has never spoken to before because she was quite popular looked and then asked \u201CHow did you do that?\u201D Matthew answered for Rory by saying \u201CWhy do you wanna know?\u201D Frankie replied \u201CI might be popular but I do care.\u201D Rory replied \u201CI did it myself.\u201D Frankie replied \u201CWhy?\u201D Rory whispered \u201CBullies\u201D. Frankie explained \u201Caww don\u2019t let them get to you.\u201D Rory sadly replied \u201CToo late\u201D. \n\nAt lunch Rory was sitting with Rachay, Julie, Lola, Lulu, Mathew, Carly and Frankie They were speaking about One Direction and Justin Bieber. Then all of sudden Leo starting whispering into Matthew\u2019s ear \u201CYou could have been popular\u201D Matthew replied I\u2019d rather be unpopular than a bully.\u201D Leo replied \u201Chahaha your choice\u201D. \nAt break Rory wanted some alone time and was walking on the misty field suddenly the gang came over. Rory quietly asked \u201CCan you go away please?\u201D the gang all laughed and James replied \u201Cnot a chance!\u201D they all teased Rory for about ten minutes. \n \nWhen they walked away Rory started to cry. Lauren Rory\u2019s big sister came over and softly asked \u201CWhat\u2019s up bud?\u201D Rory didn\u2019t reply. Rachay came over and told Lauren the whole thing. Lauren gave Rory a massive hug. A tear started to slowly drip down Lauren\u2019s face, she tried to hold them in so Rory didn\u2019t cry more. Lauren hated seeing Rory like this and planned to do something about it. \n\nAt home Rory was explaining the bullying to Lauren. Lauren couldn\u2019t understand why people would do this and comforted Rory and she let him know she would always there for him thick and thin. There was a knock on the door. It was Rachay and Carly. Lauren opened the door and led them in to the brightly coloured second living room.  It was a sky blue colour. Rory was sitting on a brownish sofa Lauren was sitting beside him crying but trying so hard to keep it in. Rachay asked \u201Ccan I see your phone please?\u201D Rory nodded Rachay saw all the threats from over 6 different numbers. Rachay asked Lauren \u201Chave you seen this?\u201D Lauren looked through all the messages and started to get angry. Rory ran to his room and locked the door and put One Direction on. Carly ran up the stairs and knocked on his room door and in a soft voice asked \u201Ccan I come in please?\u201D Rory unlocked the door and Carly walked in and saw blood on his jumper. She said \u201CDon\u2019t do this again please for me, for your sister and for Rachay.\u201D Rory cried \u201CI can\u2019t cope with this I couldn\u2019t at the beginning and I can\u2019t now!\u201D Lauren walked in and saw what he has done, she softly explained \u201CDon\u2019t do this ever again! You can go through this I\u2019ll be by your side the whole time\u201D.  \n\nChapter 2 \u201CConfidence\u201D\n\nLauren walked to school with Rory, Carly and Rachay.  Rory saw the four boys and hid behind Lauren. Rachay spotted them to and told Lauren that was them. Lauren walked over and asked them \u201CBullying my little brother are you?\u201D Jack replied \u201Cwho\u2019s you brother\u201D Lauren replied \u201CRory\u201D Trevor explained \u201CNo were really good friends\u201D Rachay stepped forward and angrily replied \u201CNo you\u2019re not I saw you beating him up.\u201D Carly asked \u201CWhy? Do you what you\u2019ve made him do? He self-harms, He starves himself and he can\u2019t cope but that\u2019s what you wanted wasn\u2019t it\u201D. Lauren walked away and so did the others.\nIn the next lesson Lulu was looking after Rory as Lauren was in a different year to them. To be honest the gang didn\u2019t care what Carly and Lauren said and carried on bullying Rory. Rory was feeling mentally weak as usual but he felt a bit more confident in himself and started to answer questions asked to the class. \n \nLater in the day Rory was walking to his locker when Trevor put him up against the wall and explained \u201CTell one more person and your life is over\u201D Trevor let go and Rory fell to the floor and Trevor started to kick him and punch him. Rory\u2019s nose was bleeding and his arm had loads of bruises on. Lauren ran over and took him to the schools nurse. \nIn the nurses room Rory was sitting there crying in pain whilst Lauren was hugging him. The nurse was checking his pulse, Blood pressure etc. The nurse said \u201CRory will need to come to me once every week for 3 weeks\u201D Lauren replied \u201Cok ill make sure he does\u201D. \n\nChapter 3 \u201CRunaway\u201D\nRory couldn\u2019t cope anymore and loads of thoughts were going through his head and he decided he\u2019s going to run away. \nWhen he got home he posted on Facebook \u201CTime To give in \u201Cno one knew what this meant and just left him to live his life. No one knew what Rory was planning. He took his wallet, some food and a drink.\nHe made sure no one heard the door close and ran as fast as he could to find somewhere no one would no one would know where he is. He ran to a park and hid in the woods and opened his sleeping bag. He prayed for his friends and family.  He took a photo of Lauren with him so he remembered her. \n\nAt home Lauren was going to bed and went to go and kiss goodnight to Rory. She walked in and saw a note on the bed it read:\n\nDear whoever is reading this?\nI love you so much but I\u2019m getting bullied and I can\u2019t cope any more. I have decided to run away and help people and keep them happy because they don\u2019t care about me no one does. So yeah my life is terrible and I have written and rewritten loads of time. I have feel bad about this but I love you guy\u2019s loads. Lauren you an amazing sister and I love you very much. Lulu, Julie, Rachay, Matthew, Lola and Carly I love you guys as family. \nLove Rory\nXxx\nLauren began to cry she was crying so much it didn\u2019t stop for over ten minutes. She rang every friend on the list about Rory running away knowing it was 10:30. Everyone met up and went looking for him. Lauren rang the police. Everyone went looking for him.\n\nThe next day at school the speakers blasted \u201COur best student Rory Green has gone missing, please help look for him.\u201D Lauren went looking for bullies and found them she put Trevor up against the wall and shouted \u201CYou did this to him you made him do this and you think its hilarious do you?\u201D Trevor mumbled \u201CYeah it\u2019s his fault and high fived Leo\u201D Lauren got angry and slapped him.\nAfter school Lauren and the people on the list were looking for Rory. The police couldn\u2019t continue the search and told Lauren. Tears started to pour down her fear filled face Rachay and Carly was comforting her and Rachay said \u201CWe WILL find him!\u201D \nRory didn\u2019t know they were searching for him and started sing and heard Lauren coming singing \u201CKeep holding on\u201D Rory began to cry. He though no one cared about him thou so he stayed silent as he was scared that he was going to get told off he was scared of what was going to happen he thought that the his mum would hate him and Lauren wouldn\u2019t want to speak to him ever again, yeah she was upset but she cared about him more than anyone else would and she wouldn\u2019t give up searching for him. Matthew saw Lauren walking through the bushes and asked \u201Chave you found him?\u201D Lauren replied \u201CNo you?\u201D Matthew replied \u201Cnope\u201D and Carly ran over and shouted \u201CI FOUND HIS COAT!\u201D everyone ran over to where she was. They followed the direction of the coat. They found blood track and was scared something has happened. They found a video camera and it was Rory\u2019s it was speaking and crying he said \u201Cwhoever is watching this I\u2019m Rory I\u2019m a victim of bullying I have given in but you don\u2019t have to fight bullying for me but all I can say is goodbye\u201D. Tears were sprinting down her face. They decided to carry on searching they saw a sleeping bag in a distance but nobody or no one there Lauren didn\u2019t stop searching. Matthew shouted \u201CI FOUND HIIS BODY!\u201D Lauren ran over and he was knocked out she rang the hospital and they were their five minutes after Lauren called. They took Rory to the hospital.\n\nIn the hospital they were worried that too much blood came out of his body, they thought he was dying and would be dead in a couple of hours \u201CBEEP BEEP\u201D an alarm went off Lauren and Carly got worried and it meant he has stopped breathing loads of doctors came in shouting \u201CCLEAR!\u201D and pumped his heart he was breathing again. They filled his body with a blood from a blood transfer patient. The next day Rory woke up to Lauren by his side she said \u201CI told you I\u2019ll always be there for you\u201D Carly was holding Rory\u2019s hand with her eyes close praying he will be ok.

Rory had to go to the school nurse to day and get the normal check-up since he was beaten up.\n\nAfter school Rory ran to the place he felt safe, The hill by his house he would sit up their remembering his best friend that died due to cancer ages ago when he was 5 they would play tag and create swings together and he would never leave Rory which to Rory meant it was his fault it would make him cry but it would give him good memories.  \n \nThey would all be together since Peters last two minutes which Rory meant it was his fault. Lauren knew where Rory goes every Tuesday and that was the hill so Lauren would let Rory have half an hour alone then come and find him. Lauren would hug him every time he was up their but he would never forget him he cared too much.\nAt school Rory had treated the same but by what his friends have said had put more self confidence in Rory a lot. The meetings with the school nurse helped his bruise heal and his mind to change a bit so he could hopefully get more confidence in himself. His friends understood him.\n\nAt break the gang ganged up on Rory and Matthew. Jack was holding Matthew whilst Leo was punching and kicking him meanwhile James was holding Rory and Trevor was punching him in the face. Rory got his blood in his tears and his tears went red. Matthew was more worried about Rory. He punched Leo and kicked James got hold of Trevor round the neck through him against the wall and pushed James into the wall. Rory asked \u201Cwhy did you do that?\u201D Matthew replied \u201CI have had enough of them hurting you.\u201D Lauren was going to her locker when she saw them on the floor she brought tissues out of her bag and gave them to the two blonde boys.\n\n   Amanda, Rory\u2019s friend of NO Bullying the page on Facebook was video calling Rory when someone came in there and shouted \u201CWHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING\u201D he pushed him to the floor it was his brother who abused him quite a lot.

Lauren brought Rory One Direction tickets for 4th of April. Rory would be so happy and Lauren invited 3 friends Rachay, Carly and Leonie. They all kept it a secret and they were really excited.\nMeanwhile Rory and Matthew were playing FIFA 13 on the Xbox 360. Rory was really good at it and won every match against Matthew.  Rory was really good at this and he was really good at PES as well he loved every football game there was and he was good at it to.\nAshleigh was getting posts on her Facebook \u201CHaha you\u2019re going out with a geek\u201D and so on. She didn\u2019t care what other people thought to be honest she loved him and he loved her and all that matters. Their relationship was strong it\u2019s like you couldn\u2019t break it.\nAt school the next day in the playground Rachay, Julie, Ashleigh, Lulu, Carly, Leonie, Matthew and Ashleigh was talking about Rory\u2019s surprise birthday party. It was going to be massive. It is in three weeks. Rory was with Emily, Ashleigh\u2019s friend walking around the playground talking about what happens to him. Trevor came over and said \u201Ccheating on her already you dirty scum\u201D Emily replied \u201CNo were just friends actually\u201D Trevor didn\u2019t answer he just nodded and pushed Trevor to the floor and laughed and walked away. Rory was in so much pain he fell to the ground. He got helped up by Emily and took him into the class.\n\nChapter 6 \u201CThe Funeral\u201D\n\nAt home Rory checked his phone and saw he had threats from loads of people. He really didn\u2019t want to live but there was something in his head that made him wanted to stay alive and show people he might not be physically strong but he is mentally strong.  \nAfter school Rory was with his friend called Jess they were talking about how she\u2019s getting bullied by the popular girls Jess always tried to help Rory stay alive. She cared about him more than everyone else.\nOn Saturday Rory was going into town with Leonie they were going to look at clothes and stuff Rory\u2019s phone was on low battery and he received a message from Jess saying \u201Chey=(\u201C Rory\u2019s phone ran out of battery he was upset what was wrong with Jess. On Wednesday Jess said to Rory she wanted to kill herself Rory thought she was lying and would never do that but he was wrong. Jess couldn\u2019t cope any more she just tied the rope and stood on the chair she rang Rory saying \u201CHey I can\u2019t cope anymore it\u2019s my time to leave I love you so much but I can\u2019t cope because the bullies and family isn\u2019t helping with my little brother having trouble at school I just can\u2019t live with this anymore I\u2019m so sorry.

Go and sing your heart out and I love you. See theirs upsides you won\u2019t have to hear me cry anymore so yeah love you.\u201D \nWhen he got to his gloomy home he put his phone on charge and saw all the messages and voice mail he kept on trying to ring Jess number but it went to voicemail Rory cried and cried the tears were flowing out of his eyes like it was monsoon season in India. He was still trying to get in his mind his best friend has just died he was so upset he decided to go to the special place where he felt safe with Jess and now he had to feel safe on his own there. It was a place where Jess and Rory had most of their fun. It was quite here most of the time and he would go and listen to music in the nicest place possible. \nRory went to Jess\u2019s family\u2019s house and saw there was two notes one for Rory and one for Jess\u2019s family. Rory hated what he saw and stressed and a couple weeks later he went to the funeral.\nJess\u2019s body funeral has started Rory managed to stay strong until the coffin started to disappear to the gloomy hole in the ground where you can faintly see the coffin. Friends and family through flowers down to the coffin Rory through some pictures of them both together down there and he started to cry. A small tear dripped slowly down Rory\u2019s face and fell on top of the pictures that were on top off the brown coffin. Everyone said there goodbye\u2019s and Eliot Jess\u2019s little brother saw Rory was crying and hugged him and Eliot started to cry as he realised his big sister is gone and he will never see her again.\n \n Chapter 7 \u201CUnknown Brother?\u201D\nThere was a knock the large door Rory\u2019s mum answered the door there was a 16 year old boy standing there with two bags. Rory\u2019s mum shouted \u201Coh my god you came back!\u201D the teenager replied \u201Cyeah I heard I have another brother.\u201D Rory\u2019s mum answered \u201CYeah he\u2019s called Rory and why did you runaway?\u201D The teen replied \u201Cbullies\u201D.\nThe teenager was Rory\u2019s older brother he was called Robert he went through what Rory was currently go through so he would always be there for him. He ran away from the town for 3 years because of him getting bullied and it was because he liked to shows and stuff like that and people got jealous of him because he was an amazing dancer. He got bullied so much he didn\u2019t want to stay in that town anymore. He had to get away from the people he hated. He wouldn\u2019t cry at school because he was strong enough to hold it in unless he was on his own and then he would burst into tears. \nRobert got introduced to Rory as they didn\u2019t remember each other Robert walked in and sat down on the flower patterned sofa and he said \u201C Hey, you probably don\u2019t remember me but I\u2019m your big brother and my name is Robert and I love singing, dancing and acting and ill promise I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201D Rory replied \u201CWhy did you leave me and the family Lauren didn\u2019t tell me about you why? Did you tell her not to tell me?\u201D Robert replied \u201CI didn\u2019t want anyone to be scared I didn\u2019t want anyone to be upset do you understand now? And now tell me about you\u201D Rory replied \u201CWell I\u2019m Rory and I\u2019m 12 and I love to sing, dance and act too and I\u2019m auditioning for the school musical too.\u201D \nThe next day Robert was enrolled to West Lake Secondary School and was in year 12. Robert and Lauren walked with Rory to school and Rory met his friends and his girlfriend Ashleigh. Rory went to Matthew as he called Rory and he explained \u201CTrevor knows your brother\u201D Rory got worried. Trevor approached the slightly worried Rory and asked \u201Cdo you know Robert?\u201D Rory replied \u201Cyeah he\u2019s my brother\u201D Trevor replied \u201Cwow he\u2019s the complete opposite of you he actually smiles and he\u2019s cool unlike you\u201D Matthew shouted \u201CDon\u2019t do this\u201D at Trevor Rory said \u201Cno its fine I wanna hear what he wants to say to me.\u201D Trevor replied \u201Cok You have no life he has an amazing one because he has friends and you don\u2019t and he is not depressing.\u201D Trevor pushed Rory against the wall and grabbed him by the throat and whispered into Rory\u2019s ear \u201Cyou tell Robert I\u2019ll kill you\u201D Robert saw what was happening and ran over and pushed Trevor off Rory and asked Rory and asked what was happening and Rory explained what happened. Robert was upset and had flashbacks of what happened to him when he was younger and the reason he ran away and he got told that Rory ran away but not for long. Robert didn\u2019t want it to happen Rory as he wanted to him to have a successful lie unlike he did at school but he had the main part or would be the choreographer  in the school musicals so there was good points. He was a great choreographer, the best in the town by far. He choreographed in the main theatre in the town and he had loads of successful shows and was mentioned in the newspapers quite a lot. At the auditions for this year\u2019s show \u201CBully\u201D and Rory auditioned for the main boy character called Jake and Robert auditioned for a dancer. Rory got Jake and instead of a dancer Mrs Potterson the drama teacher asked him to be the choreographer and he was so happy because he loved to make his own dances and he got wanted because he was a dancer in the show to. So Rory and Robert were happy on the way home and excited and Robert was so proud of Rory. They were after school auditions so when they got home Rory ran and told Lauren and his mum and Robert did the same they were so proud of each other. Robert and Rory hugged each other as they were so happy. \n\n~Asda<3~","source":"web","type":"status"},"interaction":{"author":{"avatar":"https://graph.facebook.com/217307585064491/picture","id":"217307585064491","link":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=217307585064491","name":"Directioners Forever"},"content":"Runaway \nBy Adam Brownsord\n\n \nChapter One \u201CThe Bullying\n\u201CLeave me alone\u201D Rory shouted sitting hugging his legs and crying. The four bullies Trevor, James, Leo and Jack were standing there laughing and Trevor the leader of the gang said \u201CNO! Why would we do that?\u201D Rory Whispered \u201Cplease, please just go\u201D. Trevor put Rory against the wall and shouted \u201Cwere you speaking about me?\u201D Rory stayed silent Trevor waited for about 10 seconds and shouted \u201Chuh ignoring me yeah? Bad idea you better watch your back.\u201D Rory was petrified but he thought he had to get on with his day so he didn\u2019t tell anyone\n. Through the day Rory was getting more scared as the day went on but he hid it with a fake smile. Carly Rory\u2019s friend thought something was wrong but didn\u2019t quite know and she was quite worried about her best friend. Before the next lesson Carly pulled Rory to one side and asked \u201CWhat\u2019s up bud\u201D Rory replied \u201Cnothing look I\u2019m smiling\u201D and put on a fake smile once again to hide the pain. Carly didn\u2019t believe that smile she was the only person that could tell Rory\u2019s proper feelings. Carly then said in a caring voice \u201CRight I know there\u2019s something wrong and I\u2019m going to find out sooner or later. So when are you going to tell me?\u201D Rory started to cry and Carly decided to give Rory a massive hug. Rory explained \u201CI\u2019m getting bullied and it started two days ago.\u201D Carly was shocked that someone would do that to Rory. Carly didn\u2019t know how to reply to that but she found a reply \u201CCome on Rory, lift your head up for me\u201D. Rory head slowly rose as he walked to tutor. \nIn Rory\u2019s tutor were Trevor, James, Leo, Jack, Rachay, Jenny, Leah, Carly, Peter, Liam and Julie. In Rory\u2019s head no one in his tutor cares and the boys didn\u2019t but the girls cared about him more than he would ever know. Mrs Lowe, Rory\u2019s tutor she was a very nice teacher probably the nicest at the school. She was the teacher you could trust. She made an announcement that it was her last term at West Lake Secondary School. Everyone was sad except the bullies, they were cheering at the back of the classroom.\n The bell went and everyone left for the next class. Rory was the last one to leave the classroom Carly wanted to see if anything happened as the gang was out just before him so Carly hid. The gang of the 4 boys came behind Rory and followed him for a little while and then attacked him Leo held him still while Trevor, James and jack was punching and kicking Rory. Carly ran over to the pain struck boy rolling on the floor. Carly ran and got some her name was Rachay she was in Rory and Carly\u2019s tutor Rachay ran as fast as she could and got a teacher. The teacher didn\u2019t see what happened so she couldn\u2019t punish anyone and Rachay and Carly was really frustrated. \nIn maths Rory was finishing his work but paper kept on being thrown at him with threatening notes. Rory started to cry, everyone was wondering what was happening except from Bullies as they knew Carly and Rachay ran over to see what was wrong. Rory didn\u2019t answer he was too busy drowning in his tears\n. It was lunch and Rachay and Carly was sitting with Rory, Rory was still upset from the threats. Rory didn\u2019t eat much and Rachay and Carly was getting worried. Rory was starving himself. Rachay was thinking that but didn\u2019t think it was his sort of thing. Rachay, Carly and Rory was speaking about One Direction\u2019s new album \u201CTake Me Home\u201D and what their favourite song on it. Leo told Trevor what they were talking about it. Trevor approached the table they were sitting at Rory was about to walk away but Trevor grabbed his arm and twisted it Rory began to cry Rachay started to shout At Trevor \u201CWhat do you think you\u2019re doing? Get of him now!\u201D Trevor laughed and then let go and punched Rory, Rory began to cry. Carly ran and got a teacher she didn\u2019t believe that Trevor did it and when she went Trevor began to laugh as he walked away.\n In tutor and the end of the day Mrs Lowe revealed there will be a new pupil being added to the tutor group. Rory was getting a bit nervous of what their think of him. Loads of different questions went round in his head. Will he be another bully? Or will he be a victim? Will he be a friend? Or Enemy?\nIt was the end of school everyone went home Rory had to walk home today because his dad was at work and his mum was picking his brother up. Rory was quite scared because he didn\u2019t know if the bullies would be their which they were Rory ran to his house scared as they were following him he called Rachay and she came over to protect him. She felt it was her job to do so Rory didn\u2019t think anyone cared about him but Rachay and Carly definitely did they were there for him always.\n Rory was twelve and his bully s are 12-16 and he hated his life and people hated him so much. On Saturdays he attends a club where people bully him there too so he has about 8 bullies. \nIt was Friday and Rory went through his normal routine getting changed, brushing his teeth and eating breakfast etc. Rory was at breakfast when he got a text from a number he hasn\u2019t received a call or text from before. He thought it was the gang of four who bullies him and he was correct. It read \u201CGET READY TO DIE, YOU F****** B***.\u201D Rory was petrified he was right to be too. At school before everyone went to tutor everyone was in the halls and Rory saw the bullies and hoped they didn\u2019t see him. The speakers boomed out \u201Ctoday our new student starts his name is Matthew please help him settle in\u201D it went silent for about 10 seconds but the chatter started again Matthew had to wear name badge to be recognised. Rory was thinking he must be so embarrassed and he was correct. Matthew had been approached by the gang already and he was welcomed and the bullies was being nice for change, probably hoping for a new member. Julie in Rory\u2019s tutor went to speak to Matthew and he wasn\u2019t shy at all. Julie asked \u201CDo you like bullies?\u201D he replied \u201Cof course not why\u201D Julie pointed at the four and said \u201Cyou know them you just spoke to? There the bullies of this school\u201D.   He replied that he want to support the victim of the bullying. Julie led him to Rory. She explained \u201Cthis is the victim, he might not answer. He\u2019s really shy.\u201D Rory had his head down at the floor and staring at his feet. Matthew said \u201CHi I\u2019m the new boy I heard you\u2019re being bullied.\u201D Rory Replied \u201CYeah why\u201D Matthew said \u201CI want to help you\u201D. Rory just laughed. \nOn the way to class Matthew did the same as Carly and hid as he wanted to know the bullies were like. The bullies started to insult and threaten him like normal. Matthew came over to the bullies and went face to face and explained \u201CI\u2019ve heard enough of you already and I only just started. STOP BULLYING HIM OR ILL SORT IT OUT!\"  Trevor replied \u201CHaha bring it on your new and you sticking up for this t***.\u201D Rory started to cry. Matthew took Rory to one side and said \u201Care they like this all the time?\u201D Rory just nodded. Matthew took him to class.\nOn Friday after school he started to believe what people was saying didn\u2019t eat at all and started to begin self-harming himself. He would cut his wrists and hands. He didn\u2019t care he just did it yeah it was painful but it was less pain than getting bullied every day and non-stop.   He wanted to end it but he thought of his friends and what they would do and he didn\u2019t want to ruin their lives. He even wondered if they really cared, if they actually were his friends and if Matthew was using him. Rory was getting abuse. Rachay told him to like the page NO Bullying which he did he became friends with the owner Jennifer and Rory made a friend on their called Amanda she was from Ireland and they became pen-pals. She became good friends with Rory and built his confidence like Carly, Rachay, Matthew and Jenny is trying to do. Rory has been holding real emotions all his life as he thought no one cares or wants to listen about his life so he would just smile and when people ask if he\u2019s ok he would say I\u2019m fine. His friends had enough of him lying about his emotions and met up and discussed about it. They wished he would tell the truth so they could sort it out but Rory was worried if telling them would get him more bullied so he decided to suffer in silence. He received a text from Matthew saying he wants to meet up Rory Replied \u201Cok Cool\u201D. Rory walked to the park and Matthew was there with two people Rory hasn\u2019t seen before and he got scared. Matthew said \u201Ccalm down these are my friends they have been bullied but not as bad as you and I think you will get on well\u201D. Rory just smiled he said nervously \u201CWhat\u2019s their names?\u201D Matthew replied \u201CLulu and Lola\u201D.  Rory whispered \u201CHi\u201D Lulu replied first \u201CHi what\u2019s up?\u201D Rory replied \u201CBullies\u201D Lulu said \u201Caw I did but they made me who I am.\u201D Everyone went silent.  Lola thought she should lighten the mood so she said enthusiastically \u201CHey, I\u2019m Lola. I know how you feel I have been through it before but I\u2019m here to help you\u201D. Rory smiled.\n\nThe next day in maths everyone was speaking except from Rory he just sat there hiding his arms. Matthew saw this and told Rachay and Carly to see if it happens all the time. Rachay whispered \u201CDo you think he\u2019s self-harming himself?\u201D Carly said \u201CI hope not do you want me to ask?\u201D Rachay nodded. Carly approached Rory and asked \u201CWhat\u2019s up? Why are you covering your arms?\u201D Rory replied \u201CNothing and I\u2019m just cold.\u201D Matthew came over as Carly walked away. Matthew explained \u201CYou can tell us mate, were trying to look after you.\u201D Rory whispered to Matthew \u201CI have had enough of my life.\u201D Matthew replied \u201CLet me see your arms.\u201D Rory pulled his sleeves up meanwhile he was crying. Matthew explained \u201CYou shouldn\u2019t do this even if you\u2019re getting bullied.\u201D Through the tears Rory explained \u201CI\u2019ve can\u2019t cope anymore even though I couldn\u2019t cope from the beginning.\u201D Matthew nodded to Rachay, Julie, Lulu and Carly to show what they feared has happened. A girl at front called Frankie Rory has never spoken to before because she was quite popular looked and then asked \u201CHow did you do that?\u201D Matthew answered for Rory by saying \u201CWhy do you wanna know?\u201D Frankie replied \u201CI might be popular but I do care.\u201D Rory replied \u201CI did it myself.\u201D Frankie replied \u201CWhy?\u201D Rory whispered \u201CBullies\u201D. Frankie explained \u201Caww don\u2019t let them get to you.\u201D Rory sadly replied \u201CToo late\u201D. \n\nAt lunch Rory was sitting with Rachay, Julie, Lola, Lulu, Mathew, Carly and Frankie They were speaking about One Direction and Justin Bieber. Then all of sudden Leo starting whispering into Matthew\u2019s ear \u201CYou could have been popular\u201D Matthew replied I\u2019d rather be unpopular than a bully.\u201D Leo replied \u201Chahaha your choice\u201D. \nAt break Rory wanted some alone time and was walking on the misty field suddenly the gang came over. Rory quietly asked \u201CCan you go away please?\u201D the gang all laughed and James replied \u201Cnot a chance!\u201D they all teased Rory for about ten minutes. \n \nWhen they walked away Rory started to cry. Lauren Rory\u2019s big sister came over and softly asked \u201CWhat\u2019s up bud?\u201D Rory didn\u2019t reply. Rachay came over and told Lauren the whole thing. Lauren gave Rory a massive hug. A tear started to slowly drip down Lauren\u2019s face, she tried to hold them in so Rory didn\u2019t cry more. Lauren hated seeing Rory like this and planned to do something about it. \n\nAt home Rory was explaining the bullying to Lauren. Lauren couldn\u2019t understand why people would do this and comforted Rory and she let him know she would always there for him thick and thin. There was a knock on the door. It was Rachay and Carly. Lauren opened the door and led them in to the brightly coloured second living room.  It was a sky blue colour. Rory was sitting on a brownish sofa Lauren was sitting beside him crying but trying so hard to keep it in. Rachay asked \u201Ccan I see your phone please?\u201D Rory nodded Rachay saw all the threats from over 6 different numbers. Rachay asked Lauren \u201Chave you seen this?\u201D Lauren looked through all the messages and started to get angry. Rory ran to his room and locked the door and put One Direction on. Carly ran up the stairs and knocked on his room door and in a soft voice asked \u201Ccan I come in please?\u201D Rory unlocked the door and Carly walked in and saw blood on his jumper. She said \u201CDon\u2019t do this again please for me, for your sister and for Rachay.\u201D Rory cried \u201CI can\u2019t cope with this I couldn\u2019t at the beginning and I can\u2019t now!\u201D Lauren walked in and saw what he has done, she softly explained \u201CDon\u2019t do this ever again! You can go through this I\u2019ll be by your side the whole time\u201D.  \n\nChapter 2 \u201CConfidence\u201D\n\nLauren walked to school with Rory, Carly and Rachay.  Rory saw the four boys and hid behind Lauren. Rachay spotted them to and told Lauren that was them. Lauren walked over and asked them \u201CBullying my little brother are you?\u201D Jack replied \u201Cwho\u2019s you brother\u201D Lauren replied \u201CRory\u201D Trevor explained \u201CNo were really good friends\u201D Rachay stepped forward and angrily replied \u201CNo you\u2019re not I saw you beating him up.\u201D Carly asked \u201CWhy? Do you what you\u2019ve made him do? He self-harms, He starves himself and he can\u2019t cope but that\u2019s what you wanted wasn\u2019t it\u201D. Lauren walked away and so did the others.\nIn the next lesson Lulu was looking after Rory as Lauren was in a different year to them. To be honest the gang didn\u2019t care what Carly and Lauren said and carried on bullying Rory. Rory was feeling mentally weak as usual but he felt a bit more confident in himself and started to answer questions asked to the class. \n \nLater in the day Rory was walking to his locker when Trevor put him up against the wall and explained \u201CTell one more person and your life is over\u201D Trevor let go and Rory fell to the floor and Trevor started to kick him and punch him. Rory\u2019s nose was bleeding and his arm had loads of bruises on. Lauren ran over and took him to the schools nurse. \nIn the nurses room Rory was sitting there crying in pain whilst Lauren was hugging him. The nurse was checking his pulse, Blood pressure etc. The nurse said \u201CRory will need to come to me once every week for 3 weeks\u201D Lauren replied \u201Cok ill make sure he does\u201D. \n\nChapter 3 \u201CRunaway\u201D\nRory couldn\u2019t cope anymore and loads of thoughts were going through his head and he decided he\u2019s going to run away. \nWhen he got home he posted on Facebook \u201CTime To give in \u201Cno one knew what this meant and just left him to live his life. No one knew what Rory was planning. He took his wallet, some food and a drink.\nHe made sure no one heard the door close and ran as fast as he could to find somewhere no one would no one would know where he is. He ran to a park and hid in the woods and opened his sleeping bag. He prayed for his friends and family.  He took a photo of Lauren with him so he remembered her. \n\nAt home Lauren was going to bed and went to go and kiss goodnight to Rory. She walked in and saw a note on the bed it read:\n\nDear whoever is reading this?\nI love you so much but I\u2019m getting bullied and I can\u2019t cope any more. I have decided to run away and help people and keep them happy because they don\u2019t care about me no one does. So yeah my life is terrible and I have written and rewritten loads of time. I have feel bad about this but I love you guy\u2019s loads. Lauren you an amazing sister and I love you very much. Lulu, Julie, Rachay, Matthew, Lola and Carly I love you guys as family. \nLove Rory\nXxx\nLauren began to cry she was crying so much it didn\u2019t stop for over ten minutes. She rang every friend on the list about Rory running away knowing it was 10:30. Everyone met up and went looking for him. Lauren rang the police. Everyone went looking for him.\n\nThe next day at school the speakers blasted \u201COur best student Rory Green has gone missing, please help look for him.\u201D Lauren went looking for bullies and found them she put Trevor up against the wall and shouted \u201CYou did this to him you made him do this and you think its hilarious do you?\u201D Trevor mumbled \u201CYeah it\u2019s his fault and high fived Leo\u201D Lauren got angry and slapped him.\nAfter school Lauren and the people on the list were looking for Rory. The police couldn\u2019t continue the search and told Lauren. Tears started to pour down her fear filled face Rachay and Carly was comforting her and Rachay said \u201CWe WILL find him!\u201D \nRory didn\u2019t know they were searching for him and started sing and heard Lauren coming singing \u201CKeep holding on\u201D Rory began to cry. He though no one cared about him thou so he stayed silent as he was scared that he was going to get told off he was scared of what was going to happen he thought that the his mum would hate him and Lauren wouldn\u2019t want to speak to him ever again, yeah she was upset but she cared about him more than anyone else would and she wouldn\u2019t give up searching for him. Matthew saw Lauren walking through the bushes and asked \u201Chave you found him?\u201D Lauren replied \u201CNo you?\u201D Matthew replied \u201Cnope\u201D and Carly ran over and shouted \u201CI FOUND HIS COAT!\u201D everyone ran over to where she was. They followed the direction of the coat. They found blood track and was scared something has happened. They found a video camera and it was Rory\u2019s it was speaking and crying he said \u201Cwhoever is watching this I\u2019m Rory I\u2019m a victim of bullying I have given in but you don\u2019t have to fight bullying for me but all I can say is goodbye\u201D. Tears were sprinting down her face. They decided to carry on searching they saw a sleeping bag in a distance but nobody or no one there Lauren didn\u2019t stop searching. Matthew shouted \u201CI FOUND HIIS BODY!\u201D Lauren ran over and he was knocked out she rang the hospital and they were their five minutes after Lauren called. They took Rory to the hospital.\n\nIn the hospital they were worried that too much blood came out of his body, they thought he was dying and would be dead in a couple of hours \u201CBEEP BEEP\u201D an alarm went off Lauren and Carly got worried and it meant he has stopped breathing loads of doctors came in shouting \u201CCLEAR!\u201D and pumped his heart he was breathing again. They filled his body with a blood from a blood transfer patient. The next day Rory woke up to Lauren by his side she said \u201CI told you I\u2019ll always be there for you\u201D Carly was holding Rory\u2019s hand with her eyes close praying he will be ok. Rory kissed her hand and said \u201CI\u2019m alive\u201D Carly was so happy.\n\nChapter 4 \u201CHome Again\u201D\nAt school the next day it was tutor when everyone was talking and Rory was talking to Mrs Lowe about what happened and she was so shocked.\nMatthew was with Rory nearly all the time today Matthew wouldn\u2019t take his eyes of Rory in case he ran off. Rory had to go to the school nurse to day and get the normal check-up since he was beaten up.\n\nAfter school Rory ran to the place he felt safe, The hill by his house he would sit up their remembering his best friend that died due to cancer ages ago when he was 5 they would play tag and create swings together and he would never leave Rory which to Rory meant it was his fault it would make him cry but it would give him good memories.  \n \nThey would all be together since Peters last two minutes which Rory meant it was his fault. Lauren knew where Rory goes every Tuesday and that was the hill so Lauren would let Rory have half an hour alone then come and find him. Lauren would hug him every time he was up their but he would never forget him he cared too much.\nAt school Rory had treated the same but by what his friends have said had put more self confidence in Rory a lot. The meetings with the school nurse helped his bruise heal and his mind to change a bit so he could hopefully get more confidence in himself. His friends understood him.\n\nAt break the gang ganged up on Rory and Matthew. Jack was holding Matthew whilst Leo was punching and kicking him meanwhile James was holding Rory and Trevor was punching him in the face. Rory got his blood in his tears and his tears went red. Matthew was more worried about Rory. He punched Leo and kicked James got hold of Trevor round the neck through him against the wall and pushed James into the wall. Rory asked \u201Cwhy did you do that?\u201D Matthew replied \u201CI have had enough of them hurting you.\u201D Lauren was going to her locker when she saw them on the floor she brought tissues out of her bag and gave them to the two blonde boys.\n\n   Amanda, Rory\u2019s friend of NO Bullying the page on Facebook was video calling Rory when someone came in there and shouted \u201CWHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING\u201D he pushed him to the floor it was his brother who abused him quite a lot. Lauren and he fought all the time. Lauren ran in as she heard crying she saw Rory on the floor. She started shouting \u201CWHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HIM!\u201D  And got him out of the room.\n\nChapter 5 \u201CLove?\u201D\nAshleigh a popular girl in the class above was texting her friend about how cute Rory looked and about how she has found a new crush.

Lauren brought Rory One Direction tickets for 4th of April. Rory would be so happy and Lauren invited 3 friends Rachay, Carly and Leonie. They all kept it a secret and they were really excited.\nMeanwhile Rory and Matthew were playing FIFA 13 on the Xbox 360. Rory was really good at it and won every match against Matthew.  Rory was really good at this and he was really good at PES as well he loved every football game there was and he was good at it to.\nAshleigh was getting posts on her Facebook \u201CHaha you\u2019re going out with a geek\u201D and so on. She didn\u2019t care what other people thought to be honest she loved him and he loved her and all that matters. Their relationship was strong it\u2019s like you couldn\u2019t break it.\nAt school the next day in the playground Rachay, Julie, Ashleigh, Lulu, Carly, Leonie, Matthew and Ashleigh was talking about Rory\u2019s surprise birthday party. It was going to be massive. It is in three weeks. Rory was with Emily, Ashleigh\u2019s friend walking around the playground talking about what happens to him.

Rory was in so much pain he fell to the ground. He got helped up by Emily and took him into the class.\n\nChapter 6 \u201CThe Funeral\u201D\n\nAt home Rory checked his phone and saw he had threats from loads of people. He really didn\u2019t want to live but there was something in his head that made him wanted to stay alive and show people he might not be physically strong but he is mentally strong.  \nAfter school Rory was with his friend called Jess they were talking about how she\u2019s getting bullied by the popular girls Jess always tried to help Rory stay alive. She cared about him more than everyone else.\nOn Saturday Rory was going into town with Leonie they were going to look at clothes and stuff Rory\u2019s phone was on low battery and he received a message from Jess saying \u201Chey=(\u201C Rory\u2019s phone ran out of battery he was upset what was wrong with Jess. On Wednesday Jess said to Rory she wanted to kill herself Rory thought she was lying and would never do that but he was wrong. Jess couldn\u2019t cope any more she just tied the rope and stood on the chair she rang Rory saying \u201CHey I can\u2019t cope anymore it\u2019s my time to leave I love you so much but I can\u2019t cope because the bullies and family isn\u2019t helping with my little brother having trouble at school I just can\u2019t live with this anymore I\u2019m so sorry.

See theirs upsides you won\u2019t have to hear me cry anymore so yeah love you.\u201D \nWhen he got to his gloomy home he put his phone on charge and saw all the messages and voice mail he kept on trying to ring Jess number but it went to voicemail Rory cried and cried the tears were flowing out of his eyes like it was monsoon season in India. He was still trying to get in his mind his best friend has just died he was so upset he decided to go to the special place where he felt safe with Jess and now he had to feel safe on his own there. It was a place where Jess and Rory had most of their fun. It was quite here most of the time and he would go and listen to music in the nicest place possible. \nRory went to Jess\u2019s family\u2019s house and saw there was two notes one for Rory and one for Jess\u2019s family. Rory hated what he saw and stressed and a couple weeks later he went to the funeral.\nJess\u2019s body funeral has started Rory managed to stay strong until the coffin started to disappear to the gloomy hole in the ground where you can faintly see the coffin. Friends and family through flowers down to the coffin Rory through some pictures of them both together down there and he started to cry. A small tear dripped slowly down Rory\u2019s face and fell on top of the pictures that were on top off the brown coffin. Everyone said there goodbye\u2019s and Eliot Jess\u2019s little brother saw Rory was crying and hugged him and Eliot started to cry as he realised his big sister is gone and he will never see her again.\n \n Chapter 7 \u201CUnknown Brother?\u201D\nThere was a knock the large door Rory\u2019s mum answered the door there was a 16 year old boy standing there with two bags. Rory\u2019s mum shouted \u201Coh my god you came back!\u201D the teenager replied \u201Cyeah I heard I have another brother.\u201D Rory\u2019s mum answered \u201CYeah he\u2019s called Rory and why did you runaway?\u201D The teen replied \u201Cbullies\u201D.\nThe teenager was Rory\u2019s older brother he was called Robert he went through what Rory was currently go through so he would always be there for him. He ran away from the town for 3 years because of him getting bullied and it was because he liked to shows and stuff like that and people got jealous of him because he was an amazing dancer. He got bullied so much he didn\u2019t want to stay in that town anymore. He had to get away from the people he hated. He wouldn\u2019t cry at school because he was strong enough to hold it in unless he was on his own and then he would burst into tears. \nRobert got introduced to Rory as they didn\u2019t remember each other Robert walked in and sat down on the flower patterned sofa and he said \u201C Hey, you probably don\u2019t remember me but I\u2019m your big brother and my name is Robert and I love singing, dancing and acting and ill promise I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201D Rory replied \u201CWhy did you leave me and the family Lauren didn\u2019t tell me about you why? Did you tell her not to tell me?\u201D Robert replied \u201CI didn\u2019t want anyone to be scared I didn\u2019t want anyone to be upset do you understand now? And now tell me about you\u201D Rory replied \u201CWell I\u2019m Rory and I\u2019m 12 and I love to sing, dance and act too and I\u2019m auditioning for the school musical too.\u201D \nThe next day Robert was enrolled to West Lake Secondary School and was in year 12. Robert and Lauren walked with Rory to school and Rory met his friends and his girlfriend Ashleigh. Rory went to Matthew as he called Rory and he explained \u201CTrevor knows your brother\u201D Rory got worried. Trevor approached the slightly worried Rory and asked \u201Cdo you know Robert?\u201D Rory replied \u201Cyeah he\u2019s my brother\u201D Trevor replied \u201Cwow he\u2019s the complete opposite of you he actually smiles and he\u2019s cool unlike you\u201D Matthew shouted \u201CDon\u2019t do this\u201D at Trevor Rory said \u201Cno its fine I wanna hear what he wants to say to me.\u201D Trevor replied \u201Cok You have no life he has an amazing one because he has friends and you don\u2019t and he is not depressing.\u201D Trevor pushed Rory against the wall and grabbed him by the throat and whispered into Rory\u2019s ear \u201Cyou tell Robert I\u2019ll kill you\u201D Robert saw what was happening and ran over and pushed Trevor off Rory and asked Rory and asked what was happening and Rory explained what happened. Robert was upset and had flashbacks of what happened to him when he was younger and the reason he ran away and he got told that Rory ran away but not for long. Robert didn\u2019t want it to happen Rory as he wanted to him to have a successful lie unlike he did at school but he had the main part or would be the choreographer  in the school musicals so there was good points. He was a great choreographer, the best in the town by far. He choreographed in the main theatre in the town and he had loads of successful shows and was mentioned in the newspapers quite a lot. At the auditions for this year\u2019s show \u201CBully\u201D and Rory auditioned for the main boy character called Jake and Robert auditioned for a dancer. Rory got Jake and instead of a dancer Mrs Potterson the drama teacher asked him to be the choreographer and he was so happy because he loved to make his own dances and he got wanted because he was a dancer in the show to. So Rory and Robert were happy on the way home and excited and Robert was so proud of Rory. They were after school auditions so when they got home Rory ran and told Lauren and his mum and Robert did the same they were so proud of each other. Robert and Rory hugged each other as they were so happy. \n\n~Asda<3~","created_at":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 18:17:55 +0000","id":"1e2461a8b052a380e0669bb1d0791e50","schema":{"version":3},"source":"web","type":"facebook","tags":["Asda"]},"language":{"confidence":100,"tag":"en"}}
